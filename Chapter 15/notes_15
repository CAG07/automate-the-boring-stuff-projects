PDFs are binary
PyPDF2 is deprecated since December 2022. Use pypdf (as the README of PyPDF2 states)

python-docx is a Python library for creating and updating Microsoft Word (.docx) files.
https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/

Getting the Full Text from a .docx File
If you care only about the text, not the styling information, in the Word document, you can use the getText() function. It accepts a filename of a .docx file and returns a single string value of its text. 

```
#! python3

import docx

def getText(filename):
    doc = docx.Document(filename)
    fullText = []
    for para in doc.paragraphs:
        fullText.append(para.text)
    return '\n'.join(fullText)
```

Run Attributes
Runs can be further styled using text attributes. 
Each attribute can be set to one of three values: 
True (the attribute is always enabled, no matter what other styles are applied to the run), 
False (the attribute is always disabled), or None (defaults to whatever the run’s style is set to).

Writing Word Documents
>>> import docx
>>> doc = docx.Document()
>>> doc.add_paragraph('Hello, world!')
<docx.text.Paragraph object at 0x0000000003B56F60>
>>> doc.save('helloworld.docx')

Creating PDFs from Word Documents
The PyPDF2 module doesn’t allow you to create PDF documents directly, but there’s a way to generate PDF files with Python if you’re on Windows and have Microsoft Word installed. You’ll need to install the Pywin32 package by running pip install --user -U pywin32==224. With this and the docx module, you can create Word documents and then convert them to PDFs with the following script.

Open a new file editor tab, enter the following code, and save it as convertWordToPDF.py:
```
# This script runs on Windows only, and you must have Word installed.
import win32com.client # install with "pip install pywin32==224"
import docx
wordFilename = 'your_word_document.docx'
pdfFilename = 'your_pdf_filename.pdf'

doc = docx.Document()
# Code to create Word document goes here. Replace with docx function calls to create your own content for the PDF in a Word document.
doc.save(wordFilename)

wdFormatPDF = 17 # Word's numeric code for PDFs.
wordObj = win32com.client.Dispatch('Word.Application')

docObj = wordObj.Documents.Open(wordFilename)
docObj.SaveAs(pdfFilename, FileFormat=wdFormatPDF)
docObj.Close()
wordObj.Quit()
```
