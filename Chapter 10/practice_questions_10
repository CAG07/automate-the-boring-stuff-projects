Practice Questions
1. What is the difference between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?
The shutil (or shell utilities) module has functions to let you copy, move, rename, and delete files in your Python programs.
While shutil.copy() will copy a single file, shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it. Calling shutil.copytree(source, destination) will copy the folder at the path source, along with all of its files and subfolders, to the folder at the path destination.

2. What function is used to rename files?
The shutil.move() function is used for renaming files, as well as moving them.

3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?
The send2trash functions will move a file or folder to the recycle bin, while shutil functions will permanently delete files and folders.

4. ZipFile objects have a close() method just like File objects’ close() method. What ZipFile method is equivalent to File objects’ open() method?
The zipfile.ZipFile() function is equivalent to the open() function; the first argument is the filename, and the second argument is the mode to open the ZIP file in (read, write, or append).
