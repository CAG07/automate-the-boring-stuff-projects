## Copying Files and Folders
The shutil module provides functions for copying files, as well as entire folders.

Calling shutil.copy(source, destination) will copy the file at the path source to the folder at the path destination. 

While shutil.copy() will copy a single file, shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it.
