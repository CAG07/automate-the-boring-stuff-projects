True and False

>>> data = True
>>> data
True

2. What are the three Boolean operators?

or
not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

<h3>and operator truth table</h3>
TT  T
TF  F
FT  F
FF  F

<h3>or operator truth table</h3>
TT  T
TF  T
FT  T
FF  F

<h3>not operator truth table</h3>
not True  False
not False True


4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)  False
not (5 > 4)  False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)  True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))  False
(True and True) and (True == False)  False
(not False) or (not True)  True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
==
!=
<
>
<=
>=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.


8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

11. What is the difference between break and continue?

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
