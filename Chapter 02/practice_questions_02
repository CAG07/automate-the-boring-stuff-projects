Practice Questions

1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True and False

>>> data = True
>>> data
True

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
and
or
not

3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to).

<h3>and operator truth table</h3>
TT  T
TF  F
FT  F
FF  F

<h3>or operator truth table</h3>
TT  T
TF  T
FT  T
FF  F

<h3>not operator truth table</h3>
not True  False
not False True


4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)  False
not (5 > 4)  False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)  True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))  False
(True and True) and (True == False)  False
(not False) or (not True)  True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
==
!=
<
>
<=
>=

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
The == operator asks whether two values are the same
The = operator (assignment) puts the value on the right into the variable on the left

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
 Conditions always evaluate down to a Boolean value, True or False. A flow control statement decides what to do based on whether its condition is True or False, and almost every flow control statement uses a condition.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs') #block_1
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon') #block_2
    else:
        print('ham') #block_3
    print('spam')
print('spam')

9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

spam = 3
if spam == 1:
  print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
  print('Howdy')
else:
  print('Greetings!')

10. What keys can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
Ctrl + C

11. What is the difference between break and continue?
A break statement exists a loop
The continue statement jumps to the start of the loop and reevaluates the loop condition

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?
The result will be the same for all 3

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

for i in range(1, 11):
  print(i)


#Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop

i = 1
while i <= 10:
  print(i)
  i = i + 1


14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
spam.bacon()
