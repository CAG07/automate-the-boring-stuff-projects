Raw Strings
You can place an r before the beginning quotation mark of a string to make it a raw string. A raw string completely ignores all escape characters and prints any backslash that appears in the string.

print(r'That is Carol\'s cat.')
That is Carol\'s cat.

The r prefix will escape all the backslashes in a string. This is useful for strings that contain backslashes that you donâ€™t want to be escaped, such as the strings used for regular expressions described in the next chapter.

The in and not in Operators with Strings
The in and not in operators can be used with strings just like with list values. An expression with two strings joined using in or not in will evaluate to a Boolean True or False. Enter the following into the interactive shell:
>>> 'Hello' in 'Hello World'
True
>>> 'Hello' in 'Hello'
True
>>> 'HELLO' in 'Hello World'
False

F-strings
You can use f-strings to make this print() call much cleaner:
>>> name = 'Al'
>>> age = 4000
>>> f'My name is {name}. Next year I will be {age + 1}.'
'My name is Al. Next year I will be 4001.'

The f-string expression evaluates to a string, which is then passed to the print() function. Notice that the f-string expression is inside the quotes that begin and end the string. You can use single, double, or triple quotes for an f-string.
